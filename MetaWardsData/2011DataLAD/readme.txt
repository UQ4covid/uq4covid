To create the LAD-level data, you need to run the 
"createLAD.R" script file, changing the "pathToMetaWardsData" 
object at the top of the file to the location of your
MetaWardsData cloned repo.

You can also change the "path" variable, but currently the
MetaWardsData/model_data/2011UK folder doesn't have the correct
lookup table.

You may have amend the "description.json" manually.
